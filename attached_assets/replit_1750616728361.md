# File Hosting Service

## Overview

This is a professional file hosting service built with Flask that allows users to upload, organize, and manage various types of files. The application supports images, documents, and other file types with a clean, modern web interface featuring drag-and-drop functionality and file categorization.

## System Architecture

The application follows a traditional Flask web application architecture with the following components:

- **Frontend**: HTML templates with Bootstrap 5 styling and custom CSS/JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask web framework with file system-based storage
- **File Storage**: Local file system organized by categories and subcategories
- **Document Processing**: Multiple libraries for viewing different document types
- **Deployment**: Gunicorn WSGI server with autoscale deployment target

## Key Components

### File Upload System
- **Multi-file upload support** with drag-and-drop interface
- **File type validation** for images, documents, archives, videos, and audio
- **Category-based organization** with optional subcategories
- **File size limits** (500MB maximum per file)

### Document Processing
- **PDF viewing** using PyMuPDF (fitz)
- **Word document support** (.docx) using python-docx
- **Excel file support** (.xlsx) using openpyxl
- **PowerPoint support** (.pptx) using python-pptx with slide text extraction
- **OpenDocument support** (.odt) using odfpy
- **Graceful degradation** when optional libraries are not available

### File Management
- **Category browsing** with breadcrumb navigation
- **File preview and viewing** with specialized viewers for different file types
- **Bulk operations** including category deletion and ZIP downloads
- **File metadata** tracking with timestamps

### User Interface
- **Responsive design** using Bootstrap 5
- **Glass morphism styling** with gradient backgrounds
- **Interactive file viewer** with zoom, rotation, and pan controls
- **Modal-based interactions** for uploads and confirmations

## Data Flow

1. **File Upload**: Users select files and specify categories through the web interface
2. **Processing**: Flask validates file types and creates directory structure
3. **Storage**: Files are saved to `static/uploads/{category}/{subcategory}/` structure
4. **Viewing**: Files are served directly from the file system with appropriate MIME types
5. **Management**: Users can browse, download, and delete files through the web interface

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit with the following setup:

- **Runtime**: Python 3.11 with Nix package management
- **Web Server**: Gunicorn with autoscale deployment target
- **Port Configuration**: Internal port 5000, external port 80
- **File Storage**: Local file system with persistent storage
- **Environment**: Development mode with hot reloading for development

### Production Considerations
- File uploads are stored locally, which may not be suitable for distributed deployments
- No database is currently used, limiting metadata storage and user management
- Authentication and authorization are not implemented
- File storage should be moved to cloud storage for production scalability

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
